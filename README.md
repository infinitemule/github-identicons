GitHub Identicons
=================

Scala implementation of GitHub's identicons.

### Notes

This does not implement the exact algorithm that GitHub is using but it is doing something very 
similar.  It is using the way GitHib determines which squares to turn on and off.  
I don't know which which hash algorithm GitHub is using.
